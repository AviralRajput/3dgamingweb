🛠 Tools & Technologies You Can Use
🎨 Design & Prototyping
Figma: For wireframing and UI design. You’ll sketch how your landing page looks before coding.

Framer: A no-code/low-code tool that can directly turn designs into interactive websites.

Dora: A new no-code platform focused on 3D animated websites.

💻 Frontend Development
React.js: The most popular framework for building modern, responsive landing pages.

Next.js: Built on React, great for SEO and performance (important for app landing pages).

Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI: For styling quickly and making it look polished.

🌌 3D & Animation Libraries
Three.js: The go-to JavaScript library for 3D graphics in the browser.

React Three Fiber (R3F): A React wrapper for Three.js, makes it easier to use with React.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For smooth animations, cursor effects, and transitions.

WebGL Shaders: For liquid-like, wavy, or glassy background effects.

🌀 Special Effects
ShaderToy / GLSL Shaders: To create that “liquid screen” effect you mentioned.

Lottie Animations: Lightweight vector animations (exported from After Effects).

SVGator: For animated SVGs (great for logos or icons

Here’s a minimal but powerful setup:

Design (optional) → Figma (to sketch UI before coding)

Frontend Framework → React or Next.js (to build the actual site)

Styling → Tailwind CSS (to make it look modern quickly)

Animations/3D → React Three Fiber (for 3D) + GSAP (for smooth animations)

That’s it. With just these, you can make a professional, interactive landing page.

How Tools Connect Together
Think of it like a pipeline:

Figma → You design the layout (buttons, sections, colors).

Export assets (icons, images, mockups).

React/Next.js → You code the structure of the page.

Example: <HeroSection />, <Features />, <DownloadButton />.

Tailwind CSS → You style those components.

Example: className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600"

React Three Fiber → You add 3D models or effects.

Example: a floating 3D phone model showing your app.

GSAP → You animate movements, cursor effects, and transitions.

Example: background waves reacting when the mouse moves.

Deployment (Vercel/Netlify) → You host the final site online.

Step‑by‑Step Roadmap
Step 1: Google Stitch (or any moodboard/idea collection)
Collect inspiration: screenshots of landing pages you like, color palettes, typography ideas.

Goal: Define the vibe of your landing page (futuristic, minimal, playful, etc.).

👉 Once you’ve gathered your references, we’ll move to design.

Step 2: Figma (Design & Wireframe)
Create a basic wireframe:

Hero section (App name, tagline, download button).

Features section (3–4 highlights).

Screenshots/mockups of your app.

Footer (links, contact).

Don’t worry about animations yet — just layout and colors.

Export assets (logo, icons, mockup images).

👉 After you finish, share your layout (or describe it), and I’ll help refine it for coding.

Step 3: HTML / CSS / JS (Static Prototype)
Build a static version of your design:

Use plain HTML for structure.

CSS for styling (try gradients, glassmorphism, etc.).

JS for small interactions (button hover, smooth scroll).

This step helps you understand the skeleton before React.

👉 Once you’re comfortable, we’ll migrate to React/Next.js.

Step 4: React / Next.js (Dynamic Site)
Convert your static HTML/CSS into React components.

Use Next.js for routing, SEO, and deployment ease.

Add Tailwind CSS for faster styling.

👉 At this stage, your site will be functional and responsive.

Step 5: Animations & 3D
Add GSAP for smooth animations (fade‑in, scroll effects).

Add React Three Fiber for 3D models or liquid‑like backgrounds.

Optional: Use shaders for that “liquid glass” effect you mentioned.

Step 6: Deploy
Push code to GitHub.

Deploy on Vercel (free, fast, perfect for Next.js).

Connect your custom domain if you want.
